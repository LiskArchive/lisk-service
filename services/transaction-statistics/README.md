# Lisk Service Transaction Statistics

The Transaction Statistics service, as the name suggests, is primarily responsible to compute various transaction statistics to offer users various near real-time network activity insights.

> Note that this installation instruction is required only for development activities. For a regular Lisk Service user the official [documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-service/) is sufficient to run an instance. The global readme file present in the root directory describes running all the microservices simultaneously.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [README](../../README.md) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/services/transaction-statistics # move into the transaction-statistics microservice directory
yarn install --frozen-lockfile # install required Node.js dependencies
```

## Configuration

To configure the different microservices, there are several environment variables the user can define to customize the configurations.

A list of the most commonly used environment variables is presented below:

- `SERVICE_BROKER`: URL of the microservice message broker (NATS or Redis).
- `SERVICE_STATISTICS_MYSQL`: Connection string of the (read/write) primary MySQL instance that the microservice connects to.
- `SERVICE_STATISTICS_MYSQL_READ_REPLICA`: Connection string of the (read only) replicated MySQL instance that the microservice connects to.
- `SERVICE_STATISTICS_REDIS`: URL of the cache storage (Redis).
- `TRANSACTION_STATS_HISTORY_LENGTH_DAYS`: The number of days for which the transaction statistics need to be built in retrospect to the application init.
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_TRANSACTION_STATS`: Job run interval to refresh transaction statistics. By default, it is set to `0`.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_TRANSACTION_STATS`: Job run cron schedule to refresh transaction statistics. By default, it is set to run every 30th minute (`*/30 * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_VERIFY_TRANSACTION_STATS`: Job run interval to verify if the transaction statistics have been built correctly. By default, it is set to `0`.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_VERIFY_TRANSACTION_STATS`: Job run cron schedule to verify if the transaction statistics have been built correctly. By default, it is set to run every 3rd hour after the first 15 minutes (`15 */3 * * *`).

> **Note**: `interval` takes priority over `schedule` and must be greater than 0 to be valid for all the moleculer job configurations.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/services/transaction-statistics # move into the root directory of the transaction-statistics microservice
yarn start # start the microservice with running nodes locally
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test particular service endpoints.

If you want to run a production variant of the service, use `Docker` or `PM2`. This will automatically recover the process when it fails.

### Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.
