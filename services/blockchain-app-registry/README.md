# Lisk Service Blockchain Application Registry

The Blockchain Application Registry service is responsible to serve the off-chain application metadata from the [Lisk Application Registry](https://github.com/LiskHQ/app-registry) via an API.

> Note that this installation instruction is required only for development activities. For a regular Lisk Service user, the official [documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-service/) is sufficient to run an instance. The global readme file present in the root directory describes how to run all the microservices simultaneously.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [README](../../README.md) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/services/blockchain-app-registry # move into blockchain-app-registry microservice directory
yarn install --frozen-lockfile # install required Node.js dependencies
```

## Configuration

To configure the different microservices, there are several environment variables the user can define to customize the configurations.

A list of the most commonly used environment variables is presented below:

- `SERVICE_BROKER`: URL of the microservice message broker (NATS or Redis).
- `SERVICE_APP_REGISTRY_MYSQL`: Connection string of the MySQL instance that the microservice connects to.
- `ENABLE_REBUILD_INDEX_AT_INIT`: Boolean flag to truncate the index and rebuild at application init.
- `DEFAULT_APPS`: Default blockchain applications. By default, it is set to `lisk_mainchain`.
- `JOB_INTERVAL_DELETE_NON_METADATA_FILES`: Job run interval to delete non-metadata files. By default, it is set to `0`.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_DELETE_NON_METADATA_FILES`: Job run cron schedule to delete non-metadata files. By default, it is set to run every day at midnight (`0 0 * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_UPDATE_METADATA`: Job run interval to update off-chain metadata. By default, it is set to `0`.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_UPDATE_METADATA`: Job run cron schedule to update off-chain metadata. By default, it is set to run every 10 minutes (`*/10 * * * *`).

> **Note**: `interval` takes priority over `schedule` and must be greater than 0 to be valid for all the moleculer job configurations.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/services/blockchain-app-registry # move into the root directory of the blockchain-app-registry microservice
yarn start # start the microservice
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test specific service endpoints.

Once the process is verified as running correctly, press `CTRL+C` and start the process with `PM2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

### Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.
