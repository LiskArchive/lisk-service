# Lisk Service Export

The Export service allows users to download the transaction history for a specified user address or publicKey, in a CSV format to aid the auditors.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [README](../../README.md) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/services/export # move into export microservice directory
yarn install --frozen-lockfile # install required Node.js dependencies
```

## Configuration

To configure the different microservices, there are several environment variables the user can define to customize the configurations.

A list of the most commonly used environment variables is presented below:

- `SERVICE_BROKER`: URL of the microservice message broker (NATS or Redis).
- `SERVICE_EXPORT_REDIS`: URL of the permanent cache storage (Redis).
- `SERVICE_EXPORT_REDIS_VOLATILE`: URL of the volatile cache storage (Redis).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_CACHE_PURGE`: Job run interval to cleanup cache. By default, it is set to `0`.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_CACHE_PURGE`: Job run cron schedule to cleanup cache. By default, it is set to run daily at 04:45 am (`45 4 * * *`).
- `EXPORT_S3_ENDPOINT`: Amazon S3 bucket endpoint.
- `EXPORT_S3_ACCESS_KEY`: Amazon S3 bucket access key for the specified endpoint.
- `EXPORT_S3_SECRET_KEY`: Amazon S3 bucket secret key.
- `EXPORT_S3_SESSION_TOKEN`: Amazon S3 bucket session token.
- `EXPORT_S3_REGION`: Region where Amazon S3 bucket is hosted. Optional.
- `EXPORT_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Amazon S3 bucket name. Optional.

> **Note**: `interval` takes priority over `schedule` and must be greater than 0 to be valid for all the moleculer job configurations.
> **Note**: When EXPORT*S3*\* environment variables are not specified, the local filesystem is used.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/services/export # move into the root directory of the export microservice
yarn start # start the microservice
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test specific service endpoints.

Once the process is verified as running correctly, press `CTRL+C` and start the process with `PM2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

### Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.
