/**
 * This test can be used to have an overview of the changes at the time of release.
 * Definitely not suitable for CI/CD. Some routes are updated very often so two
 * different endpoints can provide different results. Market prices are different
 * but their timestamps are different as well. Different nodes can present different
 * height, the final evaluation is up to the person doing tests. Assuming that
 * each release is affecting the API these tests will never pass. That does not
 * contradict its usefulness though.
