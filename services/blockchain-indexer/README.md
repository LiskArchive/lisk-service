# Lisk Service Blockchain Indexer

The Blockchain Indexer service, in the *indexing* mode, is primarily responsible to index all the blockchain information, based on the scheduled jobs by the Blockchain Coordinator.
In the *data service* mode, it serves user request queries made via the RESTful API or WebSocket-based RPC calls.
It can run both the indexer and data service modes simultaneously, and is enabled by default.

This microservice encapsulates most of the business logic for the Lisk Service API. By default, it only implements the business logic for all the available commands from the Lisk SDK.
The *applyTransaction* and *revertTransaction* hooks implement the indexing logic and are specific to each available command. The *applyTransaction* is triggered when processing an included transaction within a new block while (usually) indexing the `chain_newBlock` event. The *revertTransaction* hook is triggered when processing an included transaction within a deleted block while processing the `chain_deleteBlock` event. All the implemented hooks are grouped [here](./shared/indexer/transactionProcessor). Command specific hooks are always implemented within a single file and are grouped by the module. When interested in extending Lisk Service and implementing hooks for your custom modules, please check the [Extending Indexer](#extending-indexer) section below.

> Note that this installation instruction is required only for development activities. For a regular Lisk Service user the official [documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-service/) is sufficient to run an instance. The global readme file present in the root directory describes running all the microservices at once.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [README](../../README.md) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/services/blockchain-indexer # move into blockchain-indexer microservice directory
yarn install --frozen-lockfile # install required Node.js dependencies
```

## Configuration

To configure the different microservices, there are several environment variables the user can define to customize the configurations.

A list of the most commonly used environment variables is presented below:

- `SERVICE_BROKER`: URL of the microservice message broker (Redis).
- `SERVICE_INDEXER_MYSQL`: Connection string of the (read/write) primary MySQL instance that the microservice connects to.
- `SERVICE_INDEXER_MYSQL_READ_REPLICA`: Connection string of the (read only) replicated MySQL instance that the microservice connects to.
- `SERVICE_MESSAGE_QUEUE_REDIS`: URL of the job queue to process the scheduled indexing jobs by the Blockchain Coordinator (Redis).
- `SERVICE_INDEXER_REDIS_VOLATILE`: URL of the volatile cache storage (Redis).
- `ENABLE_DATA_RETRIEVAL_MODE`: Boolean flag to enable the Data Service mode.
- `ENABLE_INDEXING_MODE`: Boolean flag to enable the Data Indexing mode.
- `ENABLE_PERSIST_EVENTS`: Boolean flag to permanently maintain the events in the MySQL database.
- `ENABLE_APPLY_SNAPSHOT`: Boolean flag to enable initialization of the index with the Lisk Service DB snapshot.
- `INDEX_SNAPSHOT_URL`: URL from where the Lisk Service DB snapshot will be downloaded.
- `ENABLE_SNAPSHOT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`: Boolean flag to enable downloading snapshot from an (unsecured) HTTP URL.
- `LISK_STATIC`: URL of Lisk static assets.
- `SERVICE_INDEXER_CACHE_REDIS`: URL of the cache storage (Redis).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_DELETE_SERIALIZED_EVENTS`: Job run interval to delete serialized events. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_DELETE_SERIALIZED_EVENTS`: Job run cron schedule to delete serialized events. By default, it is set to run every 5th minute (`*/5 * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_VALIDATORS`: Job run interval to refresh validators cache. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_VALIDATORS`: Job run cron schedule to refresh validators cache. By default, it is set to run every 5th minute (`*/5 * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_VALIDATE_VALIDATORS_RANK`: Job run interval to validate the rank for all the validators. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_VALIDATE_VALIDATORS_RANK`: Job run cron schedule to validate the rank for all the validators. By default, it is set to run every 15 minutes, and starts at 4 minutes past the hour (`4-59/15 * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_INDEX_STATUS`: Job run interval to refresh indexing status. By default, it is set to run every 10 seconds.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_INDEX_STATUS`: Job run cron schedule to refresh indexing status. By default, it is set to ''.
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_BLOCKCHAIN_APPS_STATS`: Job run interval to refresh blockchain application statistics. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_BLOCKCHAIN_APPS_STATS`: Job run cron schedule to refresh blockchain application statistics. By default, it is set to run every 15th minute (`*/15 * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_ACCOUNT_KNOWLEDGE`: Job run interval to refresh account knowledge. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_ACCOUNT_KNOWLEDGE`: Job run cron schedule to refresh account knowledge. By default, it is set to run every 15th minute (`*/15 * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_DELETE_FINALIZED_CCU_METADATA`: Job run interval to delete finalized CCU metadata. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_DELETE_FINALIZED_CCU_METADATA`: Job run cron schedule to delete finalized CCU metadata. By default, it is set to run once a day at 02:00 am (`0 2 * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_TRIGGER_ACCOUNT_UPDATES`: Job run interval to trigger account updates. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_TRIGGER_ACCOUNT_UPDATES`: Job run cron schedule to trigger account updates. By default, it is set to run every 15th minute (`*/15 * * * *`).
- `ESTIMATES_BUFFER_BYTES_LENGTH`: Transaction buffer bytes to consider when estimating the transaction fees. By default, it is set to 0.
- `MAINCHAIN_SERVICE_URL`: Mainchain service URL for custom deployments.

> **Note**: `interval` takes priority over `schedule` and must be greater than 0 to be valid for all the moleculer job configurations.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/services/blockchain-indexer # move into the root directory of the blockchain-indexer microservice
yarn start # start the microservice with running nodes locally
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test particular service endpoints.

If you want to run a production variant of the service, use `Docker` or `PM2`. This will automatically recover the process when it fails.

### Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.

## Extending Indexer

The *applyTransaction* and *revertTransaction* hooks are arranged per command in a file and are grouped by the module that they belong to.<br />
Existing hooks are located in the [shared/indexer/transactionProcessor](./shared/indexer/transactionProcessor) directory.

When implementing the custom hooks please adhere to the following:

- Create a sub-directory with the module name. For example: [token](./shared/indexer/transactionProcessor/token).
- Add `index.js` under the above directory.
  - Export a `MODULE_NAME` variable. The value must match the *module* name as registered within the application.
- Create a file specific to the command for which you need to implement the custom hooks. For example: [transfer](./shared/indexer/transactionProcessor/token/transfer.js).
  - Export a `COMMAND_NAME` variable. The value must match the *command* name as registered within the application.
  - Implement the custom logic for the `applyTransaction` and `revertTransaction` hooks.
  - Export the hooks.
- To aid your development, please use the sample templates [here](./shared/indexer/transactionProcessor/0_moduleName).
