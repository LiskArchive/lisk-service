# Lisk Service Market

The Market service allows price data retrieval. It supports multiple sources to keep the current Lisk token price up-to-date and available to the clients in real-time.

> Note that this installation instruction is required only for development activities. For a regular Lisk Service user the official [documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-service/) is sufficient to run an instance. The global readme file present in the root directory describes running all the microservices simultaneously.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [README](../../README.md) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/services/market # move into market microservice directory
yarn install --frozen-lockfile # install required Node.js dependencies
```

## Configuration

To configure the different microservices, there are several environment variables the user can define to customize the configurations.

A list of the most commonly used environment variables is presented below:

- `SERVICE_BROKER`: URL of the microservice message broker (NATS or Redis).
- `SERVICE_MARKET_REDIS`: URL of the cache storage (Redis).
- `EXCHANGERATESAPI_IO_API_KEY`: Access key to fetch data from the exchangeratesapi.io API.
- `SERVICE_MARKET_FIAT_CURRENCIES`: Supported fiat currencies.
- `SERVICE_MARKET_TARGET_PAIRS`: Supported target pairs.
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_PRICES_BINANCE`: Job run interval to refresh prices from Binance. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_PRICES_BINANCE`: Job run cron schedule to refresh prices from Binance. By default, it is set to run every minute (`* * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_PRICES_BITTREX`: Job run interval to refresh prices from Bittrex. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_PRICES_BITTREX`: Job run cron schedule to refresh prices from Bittrex. By default, it is set to run every minute (`* * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_PRICES_EXCHANGERATESAPI`: Job run interval to refresh prices from exchangeratesapi. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_PRICES_EXCHANGERATESAPI`: Job run cron schedule to refresh prices from exchangeratesapi. By default, it is set to run every minute (`* * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_REFRESH_PRICES_KRAKEN`: Job run interval to refresh prices from Kraken. By default, it is set to 0.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_REFRESH_PRICES_KRAKEN`: Job run cron schedule to refresh prices from Kraken. By default, it is set to run every minute (`* * * * *`).
- `JOB_INTERVAL_UPDATE_PRICES`: Job run interval to update market prices. By default, it is set to run every 5 seconds.
- `JOB_SCHEDULE_UPDATE_PRICES`: Job run cron schedule to update market prices. By default, it is set to ''.

> **Note**: `interval` takes priority over `schedule` and must be greater than 0 to be valid for all the moleculer job configurations.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/services/market # move into the root directory of the market microservice
yarn start # start the microservice with running nodes locally
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test particular service endpoints.

If you want to run a production variant of the service, use `Docker` or `PM2`. This will automatically recover the process when it fails.

### Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.
