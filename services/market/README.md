# Lisk Service Market

> Note that this installation instruction is required only for the purpose of development activities. For a regular Lisk Service user the official [documentation](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-service/) is sufficient to run their own instance. The global readme file present in the root directory describes running all microservices at once.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the readme file (`README.md`) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/components/market # move into core component folder
npm install # install required Node.js modules
```

## Configuration

To configure the different components, there are a number of environment variables, the user can define in order to customize the configurations.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/components/market # move into root folder of the core component
npm start # start the component with running nodes locally
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test particular service endpoints.

If you want to run a production variant of the service use `Docker` or `PM2`. This will automatically recover the process when it fails.

#### Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.
