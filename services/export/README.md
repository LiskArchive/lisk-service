# Lisk Service Export

TBD

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the readme file (`README.md`) in the project root directory.

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Service Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git # clone repository
cd lisk-service/services/export # move into export microservice directory
npm install # install required Node.js dependencies
```

## Configuration

To configure the different microservices, there are a number of environment variables, the user can define in order to customize the configurations.

## Management

### Start

```bash
cd lisk-service/services/export # move into root directory of the export microservice
npm start # start the microservice
```

Use the `framework/bin/moleculer_client.js` and `framework/bin/moleculer_subscribe.js` clients to test specific service endpoints.

Once the process is verified as running correctly, `CTRL+C` and start the process with `PM2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

#### Stop Lisk Service

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process.
