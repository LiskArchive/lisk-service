How to set up Lisk Service and connect it to a local Lisk Core node.

[NOTE]
====
*Pre-requisite*

Lisk Service is a web application middleware that allows interaction with various blockchain networks based on the Lisk protocol.
It is recommended to set up a blockchain node first, before setting up Lisk Service.

* To set up a Lisk-Core node, see any of our setup guides, such as xref:{url_core_setup_npm}[].
* Alternatively, you can setup up a sidechain node to connect to Lisk Service.
* Please make sure to set `system.keepEventsForHeights: -1` in the node config before synchronizing the node with the network.
====

== Setting up Lisk Service

=== Prerequisites

==== Requirements

Supported Platforms::
* Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x86_64
* Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) x86_64
* MacOS x86_64

Node.js::
* 18

The following system requirements are recommended:

Memory::
* Machines with a minimum of 16 GB RAM for the Mainnet.

* Machines with a minimum of 16 GB RAM for the Testnet.

Storage::
* Machines with a minimum of 40 GB HDD.

The following dependencies are required to install and run Lisk Service with Docker.

==== Development tools

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu / Debian::
+
--
Install the `build-essential` package alongside several development tools.

For example, use `apt` if running Ubuntu as shown in the following command below:


----
apt install build-essential git
----
--
MacOS::
+
--

*Brew*

Install https://brew.sh/[Brew] by following https://brew.sh/[the most recent instruction].

If you already have Brew installed, ensure it is working and is the latest version.

.Update current brew installation
----
brew update
----

.Verify the brew installation
----
brew doctor
----

*Xcode*

Install https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode] essentials coming from Apple.


----
xcode-select --install
----
--
====

==== Docker & Docker compose

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu / Debian::
+
--
. Please refer to the {url_docker_install_linux}[Docker installation for Ubuntu^].
. To install Docker Compose, please refer to {url_docker_install_linux_compose}[Install Docker Compose^].
. To configure Docker so it can be run without `sudo` rights, follow: {url_docker_linux_post_install}[Linux post install^].
--
MacOS::
+
--
. Please refer to {url_docker_install_mac}[Docker installation for Mac^]. Please note that Docker for Mac already includes Docker Compose.
--
====

==== Open necessary ports

Ensure the port which allows external services communication with the Lisk Service APIs is open.

- The *default* API port for *HTTP* & *WebSocket* is: `9901`

.Example: Opening port 9901 with ufw on Ubuntu
----
sudo ufw allow 9901
----

=== Installation of Lisk Service

Clone the {url_github_service}[lisk-service^] GitHub repository and then navigate into the project folder.


----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git
----

----
cd lisk-service
----

Switch to the latest release branch.

----
git checkout v0.7.0
----

== Build Lisk Service

To build Lisk Service from local files, first, navigate to the `lisk-service` repository on your system:

.Working directory: lisk-service/
----
make build-images
----

Lisk Service is now ready to use on your machine.

TIP: If you skipped the step to configure Docker to run without `*sudo*` rights, you need to prepend `*sudo*` with aforementioned command: `*sudo make build-images*`

== Connecting Lisk Service to a blockchain node

Before running the application copy the default docker-compose environment file:

.Working directory: lisk-service/
----
cp docker/example.env .env
----

In the next step, open `.env` to set the required environment variables.

.Working directory: lisk-service/
----
vim .env
----

..env
----
# Lisk ecosystem configuration
LISK_APP_WS=ws://host.docker.internal:7887
----

The `example.env` assumes that the blockchain node e.g. Lisk Core node is running on the host machine, and not inside of a Docker container.

When running a blockchain node inside of a Docker container, the following variable needs to refer to the container.
For this to work, the container running the blockchain node and the Lisk Service Blockchain Connector container must share the same docker network:

..env
----
# Lisk ecosystem configuration
LISK_APP_WS="ws://<your_docker_container>:7887"
----

TIP: For a complete list of supported environment variables check the xref:{url_references_config}[].

== Starting Lisk Service

Run the following command to start Lisk Service:

.Working directory: lisk-service/
----
make up
----

== Stopping Lisk Service
You can stop Lisk Service again with the following command:

.Working directory: lisk-service/
----
make down
----

More commands about how to manage Lisk Service are described on the xref:{url_management}[] page.

// TIP: Check the xref:{url_index_usage}[Usage] section for examples of how to use and interact with Lisk Service.
