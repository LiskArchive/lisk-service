# Lisk Service Migration Guide

## `0.5.0` -> `0.6.0`

### CSV transaction export

Lisk Service 0.6.0 allows to export transactions in CSV format.

To enable this feature ensure that your PM2 config has the lisk-service-export microservice started. The Docker script enables it automatically, however, the gateway needs a param to enable it to the public.

Consider adding the `http-exports` string to `ENABLE_HTTP_API` in order to make this feature available for users.

`ENABLE_HTTP_API=http-status,http-version3,http-exports`

### Blockchain index

Starting from `0.6.0` it is not necessary to rebuild the index for every release. This significantly reduces the time required during migrations, therefore minimizing disruption of the Lisk Service availability.

To create a snapshot on the `0.5.0` instance, execute the following commands below: 

```bash
docker-compose stop core
docker-compose exec -T mysql_core mysqldump --no-create-db lisk -u root -ppassword > mysql_core_index.sql
```

Now it is possible to stop Lisk Service and destroy the old containers.

```bash
make down
```

Alternatively, you can download the snapshot online.

```bash
wget https://snapshots.lisk.io/mainnet/service-core-snapshot.sql.gz -O service-core-snapshot.sql.gz
wget https://snapshots.lisk.io/mainnet/service-core-snapshot.sql.gz.SHA256 -O- | sha256sum -c
gzip -dc service-core-snapshot.sql.gz > mysql_core_index.sql
```

Now switch to the `0.6.0` tag.

```bash
git checkout 0.6.0
make build
```

Ensure the file `mysql_core_index.sql` is placed in your root directory.
Then restore the backup in the `0.6.0` instance.

```bash
make up            # Start the new Lisk Service
make stop-core     # Stop the core microservice
make flush-db      # Drops the new empty index
make restore-db    # Restore the index from the snapshot
make start-core    # Start the core microservice
```

Now the index will catch up with the recently produced blocks.

This will also cause account re-indexing and will take around 10 minutes. In the meantime, the blockchain index will reach 100% and at this point, Lisk Service will then be fully operational. Once 100% is reached CSV exports are then possible.

We are currently working on integrating this into a standard Lisk Service procedure, stay tuned for further updates.
