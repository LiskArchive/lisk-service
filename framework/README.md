# Lisk Service App Framework

Lisk Service Framework is made for quick development of Micoservice-based applications with minimal requirements.

It has the following features built-in:

- Microservice framework based on Moleculer
- Logger with GELF support
- HTTP library with LRU cache
- WebSocket Client

All modules can be easily replaced by other libraries when needed.

## Installation

Set the target URL to the desired tarball distribution permalink.

```
yarn install https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service/raw/d63fb9be0e01a28ea8dc5f87a2d1b70a61650dda/framework/dist/lisk-service-framework-1.4.22.tgz
```

## Quick Start

Following example works with Redis as a service broker.
Alternatively NATS can be used.

```javascript
// app.js - main application loader
const { Microservice, LoggerConfig, Logger } = require('lisk-service-framework');

// Configure logger
LoggerConfig({
	level: 'info',
	stdout: 'true',
	name: 'test-microservice',
	version: '1.0.0',
});

const logger = Logger('test-microservice');

// Initialize Microservice framework
const app = Microservice({
	name: 'test',
	transporter: 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379',
	logger: Logger('test-moleculer'),
});

// Add route
app.addMethod({
	name: 'hello',
	description: 'Hello method',
	controller: async () => ({
		data: { message: 'Hello World!' },
	}),
});

// Run the application
app
	.run()
	.then(() => {
		logger.info(`Service started`);
	})
	.catch(err => {
		logger.fatal(err.stack);
	});
```
