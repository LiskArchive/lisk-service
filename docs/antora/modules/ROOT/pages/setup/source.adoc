TIP: Install from source code if you want to customize the codebase of Lisk Service, e.g. if you want to adjust the API to be fully compatible with your blockchain application.

As an alternative to the Docker image setup, it is also possible to install Lisk Service from source code.

This setup requires more steps than the Docker image installation, however this provides the developer with the possibility to customize the Lisk Service codebase.

== Prerequisites

The following dependencies are required to install and run Lisk Service from Source.

=== Update packages

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
In Ubuntu and its derivatives APT is the base package management application. Ensure your local APT registry is up-to-date.

[source,bash]
----
apt update
----
--
macOS::
+
--
Install https://brew.sh/[Brew] by following the https://brew.sh/[latest instructions].

Next, ensure your package sources are up to date:

[source,bash]
----
brew update
brew doctor
----
--
====

=== Tool chain components

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
Install the `build-essential` package alongside with several development tools.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git make
----
--
macOS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
xcode-select --install
----
--
====

=== Node.js

{url_nodejs}[Node.js^] serves as the underlying engine for code execution.
There are several different methods and version managers used to install Node.js on your system.
It is recommended to use one of the following two options:

[tabs]
====
Option A - Node version manager::
+
--
It is recommended to use a Node version manager such as {url_nvm}[NVM^].
NVM is a bash script that enables the management of multiple active Node.js versions.

. Install nvm following the {url_nvm_instructions}[official instructions^].
. Install v16 of Node.js using NVM:

.Check for the latest LTS version
[source,bash]
----
nvm ls-remote
----

.Install the latest LTS version
[source,bash]
----
nvm install 16.15.0
----
--
Option B - Node.js package::
+
--
If NVM or other package managers are not required, it is possible to install the Node package globally  as shown in the following commands below:

*Ubuntu*

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

*macOS*

For macOS, please execute the following command below:

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@12
----
--
====

=== MYSQL
MySQL is used for storing persistent data.

[NOTE]
====
Lisk Service expects a MySQL user `lisk` with password `password` and a database `lisk`.

**The MySQL user `lisk` needs to be manually created** after installing MySQL.

These values can be updated by setting the environment variable `SERVICE_CORE_MYSQL`, see the xref:{url_references_config}[]
====

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
----

--
macOS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
brew tap homebrew/services
brew install mysql@8.0
brew services start mysql@8.0
----

.Authentication
****
If you encounter issues to authenticate, and received the following error:

 caching_sha2_password' cannot be loaded: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so, 2): image not found

Try the following: Change the `default_authentication_plugin` using `mysql_native_password`.

Open up `my.cnf` .

If you are unsure where to find your `my.cnf`, use the following command:

 $ mysql --verbose --help | grep my.cnf

Add the following at the end of the file:

 default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password

Save and exit.

Next, you need to login via the terminal:

 $ mysql -uroot

Then run the following command to update the root password:

 ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';

Now you should be able to login to your MySQL 8 via your MySQL Client.
****

=== Redis

{url_redis}[Redis] is used for caching temporary data.

[tabs]
====
Redis with Docker::
+
--
**Docker Setup**

Follow the steps described in the xref:{url_setup_docker_docker}[Prerequisites > Docker] section of the "Installation with Docker" page.

**Installation**

.How to install and start Redis with Docker
[source,bash]
----
# Clone the Lisk Service repository
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git
cd lisk-service/docker/redis
git checkout v0.6.4
make up # to start Redis
----

The above commands should be enough to install Redis which is ready to use with Lisk Service.

To stop the Docker container again, execute the following commands below:

.How to stop Redis with Docker
[source,bash]
----
make down # to stop Redis
----
--
Redis system-wide::
+
--
*Ubuntu*

[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get install redis-server
----

*macOS*

[source, bash]
----
brew install redis
----
--
====


////
Lisk Service is not compatible with this service right now.
we should encourage community to make Lisk Service compatible with this service, then they can use it as alternative GeoIP service.
=== GeoJS

{url_geojs}[GeoJS] is used by the Network Monitor for IP address geo-location.

[source,bash]
----
#todo
----
////


=== PM2

{url_pm2}[PM2] manages the node process for Lisk Service and handles log rotation (Highly Recommended).

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g pm2
----

== Installation

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended that you synchronize your Lisk Core node with the network **before** starting the Lisk Service.
====

If you have not already done so, clone the {url_github_service}[lisk-service^] GitHub repository and then navigate into the project folder and check out the latest release.

[source,bash]
----
# Clone Lisk Service repository
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service.git

# Change directory to the new repository
cd lisk-service

# Switch to the recent stable as a base
git checkout v0.6.4

# ...or use the development branch
git checkout development
----

Install all npm dependencies from the root directory.

[source,bash]
----
make build-local
----

Now it is possible to start Lisk Service:


.Start Lisk Service from Source code
[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----

This will use the default configuration and connect Lisk Service to the Lisk Mainnet.

To change the default configuration, check out the page xref:{url_config}[Configuration with PM2].

More commands about how to manage Lisk Service are described on the xref:{url_management_pm2}[PM2 commands] page.

TIP: Check the xref:{url_index_usage}[Usage] section for examples of how to use and interact with Lisk Service.
